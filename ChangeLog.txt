How the Controller + GUI works:=========================================================================

All of the buttons in the GUI are car spots. Green buttons are open spots while red buttons are occupied
spots. You can use the controller window to fill parking spots with vehicles and the buttons on the GUI
will change color in real time. For demo purposes, 100 car spots and 20 motorcycle spots were hard coded
into the program. You can distinguish them in the GUI by looking at the button names since all car spots
are named "cSpot" while all motorcycle spots are named "mSpot". The only acceptable vehicle types at the
moment are "Car" and "Motorcycle". They are case sensitive.

Click the "set open" button to clear out the parking spot you specified in the "Lot Number" text area.

Click the "set closed" button to fill the spot you specified in the "Lot Number" text area with the
information you placed in the other text areas. Keep in mind you will get an error (which is displayed
at the bottom of the controller window) if you try to place a Car in a motorcycle spot or if your vehicle
type is anything other than "Car" or "Motorcycle".

Click the "edit vehicle" button to edit the Make, Model, and License plate number of the vehicle. You can
NOT change the type of vehicle that is in this spot. The edit button will ignore anything typed in the
"Vehicle Type" text area. When pressed, the "edit button" will overwrite the information of the vehicle
in the spot you specified with the information in the other text areas.

In the parking lot GUI, click on any of the buttons to display the type, make, model, and license plate number
of the vehicle that is contained in that spot. This obviously means that you won't get anything from
clicking on green buttons since those are empty spots. Only red buttons should write values to the text
boxes on the right of the parking lot GUI.
